and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.10.0] - 2026-03-21

### Added
- 🎉 **Local Rules Selector** — project-level rule templates via `agentools rules` CLI
- ✨ `agentools rules list` — list available local rule templates with descriptions and tags
- ✨ `agentools rules add <name>` — install rules to `.claude/rules/` + `.agents/rules/` (strips YAML frontmatter)
- ✨ `agentools rules status` — show installed project-level rules
- 📋 5 built-in local rule templates: react-nextjs, nestjs-backend, postgres, testing, nodejs-performance
- 🔄 Bundled workflow `/select-local-rules` — AI-driven rule selection based on project context
- Package-bundled workflows support (`package/.agents/workflows/`) — always installed regardless of sync-repo

### Changed
- `installer.js`: Added `PACKAGE_WORKFLOWS_DIR` and `getAllWorkflowFiles()` to merge package + repo workflows
- `rules-installer.js`: Added `getLocalRuleFiles()` and `REPO_LOCAL_RULES_DIR` for local rule discovery
- `cli.js`: Enhanced `list` command to show local rules count; added `rules` command routing
- Updated test for `getAvailableWorkflows()` to account for package-bundled workflows

## [2.9.1] - 2026-03-20

### Changed
- Removed `--force` flag requirement for global rules sync — rules are always updated when content changes
- Simplified `rules-installer` API: `installRulesToFile` and `installRulesToFolder` no longer accept `force` parameter
- Smart sync: skips writes when content is identical to avoid unnecessary I/O

## [2.9.0] - 2026-03-20

### Added
- 🎉 **Global Rules Sync** (.agents/rules/global/) support for all platforms
- ✨ **Claude Code & Cursor**: Folder-based rule sync to `~/.claude/rules/` and `~/.cursor/rules/`
- ✨ **Antigravity, Windsurf, Codex**: Single-file rule merge sync with specialized headers
- New command integration: Global rules auto-install during `pull`, `update`, and `install`
- Enhanced CLI output with rules installation status and repository rules listing
- Specialized `rules-installer.js` module for multi-platform rule management
- Rule versioning via managed comment headers in single-file rule platforms
- Safety check: Rule groups are updated atomically within target files

### Changed
- Refactored `installer.js` to support delegated installers (Skills, MCP, Rules)
- Updated `platforms.js` with metadata for folder-based/file-based rules
- Enhanced `sync-manager.js` to automatically stage and push `.agents/rules/`
- Improved CLI `list` command to show global rules stored in the sync-repo

### Technical Details
- **Sync Logic**: Bi-directional rule sync via Git integration
- **Merging**: Multi-source `.md` rules are aggregated with clear markers
- **Stability**: Full test coverage for rule installation logic (366 passing tests total)

## [2.8.0] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- 🎉 **MCP support for Cursor** (`~/.cursor/mcp.json`)
- 🎉 **MCP support for Windsurf** (`~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`)
- 🎉 **MCP support for Codex CLI** (`~/.codex/config.toml` - TOML format)
- TOML configuration format support for Codex CLI
- Platform-specific MCP field handling:
  - Cursor: JSON format (similar to Claude Code)
  - Windsurf: JSON format with `disabled` boolean field
  - Codex: TOML format with `enabled`, `disabled_tools` fields
- Multi-format config I/O system (JSON and TOML)
- Helper functions: `getConfigFormat()`, `readPlatformConfig()`, `writePlatformConfig()`, `buildServerConfig()`
- Comprehensive test suite for TOML support (29 new tests)

### Changed
- Expanded MCP-capable platforms from 2 to 5
- Enhanced `writeMcpToPlatformConfig()` with format-aware logic
- Refactored `writeMcpWithSecretsToPlatformConfig()` to support TOML
- Updated platform detection for Cursor, Windsurf, and Codex CLI
- Improved code modularity with extracted helper functions

### Technical Details
- **TOML Key**: Uses `mcp_servers` (underscore) instead of `mcp.servers` (dot)
- **JSON Key**: Uses `mcpServers` (camelCase) as before
- **Format Detection**: Automatic based on platform `mcpConfigFormat` field
- **Backward Compatible**: All existing platforms (Claude, Antigravity) work unchanged

### Dependencies
- Added `@iarna/toml` ^2.2.5 for TOML parsing and stringifying (latest stable, TOML 0.5 spec)

### Documentation
- Updated README with new platform matrix
- Added TOML config examples
- Documented platform-specific field differences

## [2.7.3] - 2026-02-14

## [2.7.2] - 2026-02-13

### Security

## [2.7.1] - 2026-02-13

### Security
- Enhanced secret protection mechanisms
- Improved file permission handling

## [2.7.0] - 2026-02-14

### Added

- Preservation of existing config keys (e.g., Claude's `preferences`)

### Changed

- Enhanced platform-specific field handling for `disabledTools`

## [2.6.0] - 2026-02-13

### Added
- Bitwarden integration for MCP secret management
- `agentools secrets sync` command
- Automatic secret resolution from Bitwarden vault
- MCP server configuration with `bitwardenEnv` field

### Changed
- MCP servers scanned from repo `.agents/mcp-servers/` instead of platform files
- Platform-agnostic MCP installation flow
